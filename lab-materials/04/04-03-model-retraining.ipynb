    "To retrain the YOLO model we need a prepared dataset of car images with moderate and severe accident labels.  We have such a dataset (from RoboFlow) that has annotated images and split them into training and validation datasets.  We will use this training set to retrain our currentl YOLO model.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The encode classes of objects we want to teach our model to detect is 0-'moderate' and 1-'severe'.\n",
    "2. We have created a folder for the dataset (data) and have have 2 subfolders in it: 'train' and 'valid'.  Within each subfolder we have created 2 subfolders:  'images' and 'labels'.\n",
    "3. Each image has an annotation text file in the 'labels' subfolder. The annotation text files have the same names as the image files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the images and associated annotations are ready, we create a dataset descriptor YAML file (data.yaml) that points to the created datasets and describes the object classes in them.  This YAML file is passed to the 'train' method of the model to start the training process.\n",
